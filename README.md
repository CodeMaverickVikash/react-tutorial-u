# React learning project

This project will demonstrate the learning of react concepts.

Make react app by using below command:
```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```
## React concepts

#### 1. **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: 
* It allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files.

#### 2. **Props (Properties)**:
* Parent to child comunication (single level).

#### 3. **Conditional Rendering**:
* often done using conditional statements or the ternary operator.

#### 4. **Lists and Keys**:
* React makes it easy to render lists of data by using the map function. Each item in the list should have a unique "key" to help React efficiently update the DOM.

#### 5. **Lifting the state up**: 
* Child to parent comunication (single level).

#### 6. **State**:
* State is a way for a component to maintain and manage its own data. It is mutable and can be changed using setState. State changes trigger a re-render of the component.

#### 7. **Lifecycle Methods**:
* Only for class component.

#### 8. **Hooks**:
* React Hooks are functions that adds the functionality to the functional components.

#### 9. **Event Handling**:
* most similar to traditional event handling.

#### 10. **React Router**:
* for handling navigation, it allows to create a single-page application.

#### 11. **Context API**:
* The Context API allows you to share state between components without having to pass props manually through every level of the component tree. (no level)

#### 12. **Redux**:

#### 13. **Styling component**:
* default Styling is global in react, We can make scoping by using css modules and styled-component package.

#### 14. **Fragments**:
* to reduce extra div, wrapping up elements.

#### 15. **Portal**:
* to add component on a specific element (ReactDOM.createPortal).

#### 16. **Ref**;
* useRef hook
